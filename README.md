My Roboroc Robot Cleaning Project

This project includes a C++ application that simulates the process of a cleaning robot cleaning a house. The robot can operate with capabilities to sweep or mop a specific area on a specific home map. It also includes features such as water level, battery level and charging station management.

## Features

- House map and obstacle management.
- Ability to clean a specific area.
- Water filling, charging and battery level management.
- Reports of cleaning time, area cleaned and number of obstacles.

## Use

1. Add the house map and obstacle information to the `Map.txt` file.
2. Examine the example usage in the `main.cpp` file.
3. Open a terminal in the project folder and compile and run the project files using these commands:
     ```bash
     g++ -o cleaningRobot main.cpp
     ./cleaningRobot
     ```
